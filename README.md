# Stochastic-library

This C++ library will be developed with emphasis on scientific application. Though project is related to theory of probabilities, random numbers and random number generation in specific it can find use in wide spectre of needs with stochastic approach. 

Possible applications:
- Monte Carlo methods
- Stochastic processes research
- Statistical analysis
- Games (non-deterministic behaviour)

We will make our best to create a great tool for your projects.

# Features

- Random number generators
- Generators for numbers distributed according to specified distributions
- Functions for calculating statistical parameters of data

# Build procedure

### for linux
```
cmake -B build/
cd build/
make
cd ..
# cmake -B build/ ; cd build/ ; make ; cd ..
```
The resultative executable `main` stores in `./output` folder.

# Future work

In the future, we plan to add functionality related to random processes, random vectors, correlation matrices, and their applications. But for now we have no clue about utility of mentioned stuff.
