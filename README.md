# Stochastic-library

This C++ library should become a healthy alternative for other libraries related to theory of probabilities, random numbers and random number generation in specific. We will make our best to create a great tool for using Monte Carlo methods, researching stochastic processes and other purposes.

# Features

- Random number generators
- Generators for numbers distributed according to specified distributions
- Functions for calculating statistical parameters of data

# Future work

In the future, we plan to add functionality related to random processes, random vectors, correlation matrices, and their applications. But for now we have no clue about utility of mentioned stuff.
